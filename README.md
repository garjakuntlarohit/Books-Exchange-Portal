Online Book Exchange System is a web portal which can be used to exchange books within a community or lend.
This system is developed with a purpose of helping users to lend or borrow books. Any user can register to search for a book and obtain the owner’s information. 
The user can also put in a request online to borrow or lend a book. 
This system is mainly intended to help the  students exchange their course books within a particular institution. 
In this paper, we provide the functional features and details of implementation of our developed system.
